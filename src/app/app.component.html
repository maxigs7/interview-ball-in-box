<h1>Ball in the Box</h1>
<p>
  You have to create a grid 2x2(4 cells) wherein you should show a red ball
  where you do a click in a cell. And leave a trail (ball in light red) when you
  pass the ball between cells

<div class="board">
  <app-square
    class="board-item"
    *ngFor="let square of squares$ | async"
    [square]="square"
    (click)="changeState(square)"
  ></app-square>
